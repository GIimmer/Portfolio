      <p class='text-justify'>I am a full stack developer whose background emphasizes communication and interpersonal skills. 
        I use online resources, teamwork and internal drive to accomplish tasks in the most efficient, 
        clean manner available. Prior to attending bootcamp I designed and coded a front-end website visited by 1000s, 
        even ran complex OOP simulations in Python; since then both my abilities and knowledge have grown 
        dramatically. Because of my love for algorithms and multifaceted complexity, I am seeking a back-end 
        or full-stack position. Ideally, this position would be as part of a small team – inside or out of a 
        larger company - with whom I could both develop and prove my skills.  </p>

                                                      (full-stack app in 4.5 hrs.) students are given three chances to earn either red, or shoot for the more
                                                      difficult black. Each time I earned black at the first opportunity.</p>
          <p class='text-justify'><span class='sentenceBegin'>Projects: </span>The final week of each month was spent on a project for said stack. They are found on

          <p><span class='sentenceBegin'>The takeaways: </span>are; well, numerous. There were many times when my mind would stall for a moment and I would verbalize how crazy, I mean really crazy it was that we were in (Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam). I took a two-year crash course in cultural relativism; the US from an outside perspective, and the true scope of our globe. My public-school children in Thailand were unbelievably loving and poor, often with torn shoes and clothes and blackened teeth (lower socioeconomic Thais often don’t care for baby teeth). My private school teenagers in Vietnam on the other hand were shockingly similar to teens anywhere in the Western world, having full access to US media and K-Pop and speaking excellent English in addition to Vietnamese. Victim to the same trends as everywhere (fidget spinners, Despacito); they nonetheless did seem to be possess a much greater global perspective than their US equivalent. Moving beyond the unrelated lessons…I taught for two years, typically teens, but in the end I taught students ranging from unruly 4 year olds all the way to honors 10th graders. In that time I learned to swiftly determine the complexity of subjects an individual or group would be able to handle, and continuously improved my ability to explain right up to that level. I stripped away the remaining vestiges of my fear of public speaking, and also learned to coordinate the flow of my lectures - much like an everyday nuclear reactor – too much excitement and there’s a meltdown, too little and the lights go out. My interpersonal abilities are stronger than ever, communication honed, and I finally know what an adverb is.</p>

          <p><span class='sentenceBegin'>The takeaways: </span>this position was actually a marketing position by any other name. While doing my normal duties I learned to communicate in a variety of different forms. My position involved initiating and strengthening connections with surrounding medical professionals. As you may suspect; this involved strengthening my interpersonal skills! I endeavored to communicate with equal respect and attention to detail to front desk people, nurses, doctors, and brilliant Orthopedic Surgeons making more money each second than the US Government would deem me worth where I in some sort of hostage situation. I also had quite a bit of practice on my written voice (upon doing social media for the company), as well as design skills (again, social media). The most relevant however, is my experience designing, coding, and deploying our new website. After a couple of contractors fell through, I offered my own services provided that I could put together an initial prototype. Having practiced coding frequently through that point I was confident in my front end skills, though not deployment or back end. For this reason I used Wix, though I hard coded: headers (for mobile responsiveness), the about-us page (for text flowing around images), the embedded google map, the footers (for custom links) and several JQuery event listeners. </p>

Though I was taking the as-yet useless to my life Political Science; I did learn to study here, to spend long hours with an open mind (preferably with coffee, and surrounded by other studious millennials). While my bootcamp has finally provided me the hard skills to go with my true passion of programming, WAZZU was where I learned to take hard classes and get straight A’s, hold multiple group leadership positions, and work 20 hours a week while still having fun – for most every semester. All my hard work has left me with a 3.66, or better had I avoided that first semester…In WSU I learned to take ownership of my work, to love learning, and to always go for what’s interesting – not what’s easy. Pertinent to that, if anyone reading this is interested in Psychology, Philosophy or Astrobiology in addition to CS I would love to hear what you have to say!</p>

But good lord that Introduction to Computer Science course is no joke; and I didn’t treat it like one. I watched each and every lecture, (26 hours), completed all 11 projects to their fullest extent (as is documented <a href='https://rileyturnspaige.wordpress.com/#post-50' target="_blank">here</a>), and even took each exam with its corresponding practice exam. This course took me from a state of not taking my own programming journey seriously; to knowing I was completely committed to this thing. It was here that I decided to focus on the backend - which I believe happened while solving the travelling salesman problem - as time complexity and the intrigue of maximizing efficiency snapped home.

      <h4 class='mt-5 text-center mb-3'>Personal Journey: </h4><br>
      <p><span class='sentenceBegin mt-3'>The Love: </span>Joining the legion of CS geeks has been both a long and surprisingly warm process. Prototypical basement dwelling programmer aside (and still much appreciated); developers form the basis of quite possibly the tightest large community in the world. Not only are devs unusually well-equipped to communicate with one another (online), but they actually DO so; and the industry rewards them! They (we?) are bonded by speaking our own language and being in a constant state of flux as methodologies and paradigms shift. My personal journey then, is dedicated to all of those programmers whose immense amount of work given freely to the beginners helped get me to where I am today. </p>
      <p><span class='sentenceBegin mt-3'>The Beginnings: </span>Each summer following middle school I fell deeply into some odd new computer-based obsession. The first wasn’t so productive (RuneScape), the second quite a bit more so (Adobe Photoshop); but during the third summer I finally stumbled upon programming when I accidentally hit the “View Source” button on some obscure website. Fascinated by the intermingled readable English and visible but interminable structure I had discovered my new niche. Without the same level of accessible help as we have nowadays (Udemy, CodeAcademy, Lynda) I had to resort to simply reading and replicating W3 schools HTML section, from top to bottom. My websites were ugly, littered with every imaginable tag in no order. Eventually I hopped over to the CSS section and began learning, making progressively more visually offensive websites until I got spooked by the positioning/floats tabs and left to HackThisSite…Where I learned some simple JS before summer ended and…</p>
      <p><span class='sentenceBegin mt-3'>The Rebirth: </span>Eight years later, after college I picked it up again. Having graduated with an interesting; but actionless degree, I was doing entry-level digital marketing. My boss was a wonderful man, but admittedly I was much better at the ‘digital’ and not so focused on the ‘marketing’. Searching for challenge my brain once again found programming. HTML, then CSS; even a little PHP. Months and many weekends gone by I was eventually skilled enough to recommend my own services to my boss who was looking for a new website. Using Wix, but also lots and lots of HTML, CSS, JQuery and even the Google Maps API I created perhaps the first thing I could ever be truly proud of. Newly in love with coding; I sought a position which would allow me to study in relative peace. Upon my girlfriends advice, and with my website money, I flew to Thailand.</p>
      <p><span class='sentenceBegin mt-3'>The Where Am I?: </span>English teachers in South East Asia are not only treated to mind-numbingly cool experiences (about which I would love to talk more) and great food; but also a respectable salary with low living costs. The next two years allowed me to delve deeper into CodeAcademy, YouTube, Reddits Daily Programmer, Discrete Mathematics, and eventually the entire MIT OpenCourseWare Intro to Programming course, which is documented heavily in my blog. It was here that I both explored the power of logically based languages, and decided that coding was worth the 13 thousand dollar investment of a bootcamp. Leaving Asia with an expanded and newly sharpened mind, I returned to attend Coding Dojo.</p>
      <p><span class='sentenceBegin mt-3'>The Home Stretch: </span>Bootcamp has been the culmination of a decade-old nascent love for computer science. I finally took the back end and pieced it together with the front, learned all the fundamental data structures and frameworks such that I can truly be an independent, full-stack developer. I have loved the experience, my cohort, and the opportunity it has provided me. Thank you to all of my cohort mates, my teachers, and everyone who helped get me here. Now it’s time to get a job! &lt;3 </p>
